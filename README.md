# Project Description
This is my personal fork of group project __"Whack-a-Duck."__<br>
This is still a __work-in-progress__, with details below describing our goals/ongoing efforts.<br>

Whack-a-Duck is a multiplayer, duck-centric, take on the classic game Whack-a-Mole, built with React.js and Socket.io.<br>
Test your __react__[ion] time!<br>

# How to Install & Run
Access our project directly through Heroku: https://whack-a-duck.herokuapp.com/<br>
Or, to install,
- clone the repo
- run `npm install`

To run,
- run `npm run start`
- in a browser, open http://localhost:3000

# How to Play
At the beginning of each round, the player will spawn as either the whacker or one of the ducks.<br>

As the __whacker__, your goal is to score as many points as possible by whacking ducks.<br>

As a __duck__, your goal is to eat as many colored balls as you can.<br>
You also want to avoid being whacked; do so by diving underwater and re-appearing where you are not expected.<br>
But remember: you can only hold your breath for so long!<br>

# Good luck!

## Project Description
The original idea for this app was conceived by __Michael Marshall__, and developed by a __three person team__ over roughly a week.<br>
We built our app using __React.js__ and __Socket.io__.<br>
We utilized HTML, CSS, Javascript/JSX, Node.js, Heroku, and other tools/languages.<br>
The time spent on this app, including time spent learning new tools, is estimated at __100+ hours__.<br>

## Project members:
__Asha Baker__; Front-end: design elements, components, etc.<br>

__Daniel Mace__; Back-end: React.js, Socket.io, routes, etc.<br>
Github: https://github.com/Daniibooii<br>
__Michael Marshall__; Back-end: game mechanics.<br>

Our app was demo-ed before an audience of our peers on Tues. April 24, 2018.<br>
A copy of our group PPs may be viewed here, if you'd care to __take a gander__: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VhwKmGfTeESQD21IN3UHrF33kP8ospxZBSMb2tvGDgg/edit?usp=sharing<br>
For reference, Jared, Sam, and Rowland are three more-experienced programmers who generously provided their time, expertise, and feedback to help us succeed.<br>

## Project Goals
● Solve a real-world problem<br>
● Perform research on similar web/mobile applications<br>
● Create user stories<br>
● Create user flow diagrams<br>
● Create wireframes<br>
● Use Trello for project management<br>
● Utilize React<br>
● Deploy to Heroku<br>
● Integrate one new tool or technology unknown to group members<br>
● Make it look fancy! ie: include a polished frontend/UI, follow quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming), and add a README on GitHub<br>

## Remaining Work
Code needs to be cleaned up/trimmed.<br>
Some notations need to be removed, with more detailed notations focused on functionality added.<br>
Some of our desired features need to be added; "React-ifying" our physics engine ate up a lot of time/energy.<br>
Adding in more art, polishing design elements, etc.<br>

## Notes
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)<br>
