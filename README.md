# Project Description
This is my personal fork of group project "Whack-a-Duck."<br>

Whack-a-Duck is a multiplayer, duck-centric, take on the classic game Whack-a-Mole.<br>

# How to Install & Run
Access our project directly through Heroku: https://whack-a-duck.herokuapp.com/<br>
Or, to install,
- clone the repo
- run `npm install`

To run,
- run `npm run start`
- in a browser, open http://localhost:3001

# How to Play
At the beginning of each round, the player will spawn as either the whacker or one of the ducks.<br>

As the __whacker__, your goal is to score as many points as possible by whacking ducks.<br>

As a __duck__, your goal is to avoid being whacked!<br>
Do so by diving underwater and re-appearing where you are not expected;<br> 
but remember: you can only hold your breath for so long.<br>

__Good luck!__<br>

## Project Description
The original idea for this app was conceived by __Michael Marshall__, and developed by a __three person team__ over roughly a week.<br>
We built our app using __React.js__ and __Socket.io__.<br>
We utilized HTML, CSS, Javascript/JSX, Node.js, Heroku, and other tools/languages.<br>
The time spent on this app, including time spent learning new tools, is estimated at __100+ hours__.<br>
